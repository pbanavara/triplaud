This is the  README for TripLaud a group tracking application.

The source is organized under two directories - LM and Letsmeet-server.

LM contains the android client code.
Letsmeet-server contains the node.js backend code.
nodeTrial contains some javascript code that I used to play around with leaflet and other mapping technologies.
Letsmeet directory is deprecated - the code is purely there for any learning and back-referencing purposes.

How to build - 
Client - Straightforward Android build. IMport the directory as a project in eclipse and you should be good to go.
Required dependencies - GreenDroid-googleapis, GoogleAnalytics, GoogleAPIs.

Server - Requires node 0.6.5 and up. Just run node server_mongo.js
