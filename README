This is the  README for TripLaud a group tracking application.

The source is organized under two directories - LM and Letsmeet-server.

LM contains the android client code.
Letsmeet-server contains the node.js backend code.
nodeTrial contains some javascript code that I used to paly around with leaflet and other mapping technologies.
Letsmeet directory is deprecated - the code is purely there for any learning and back-referencing purposes.
Am working on cleaning up the code and adding the required documentation.
